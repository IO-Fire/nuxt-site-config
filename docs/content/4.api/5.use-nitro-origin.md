title: useNitroOrigin()
description: A runtime safe way of accessing the Nitro origin.
---

A utility function to get the Nitro origin from the request headers.

This is a replacement for `useRequestOrigin()` which has edge-cases issues in development, prerendering and in some runtime
environments.

The nitro origin acts as the canonical origin for the site when a `url` has not been provided.

## Usage

```ts
import { useNitroOrigin } from '#imports'

const origin = useNitroOrigin()
// https://www.example.com
```
